//this is an if/else statement
//if is the keyword that tells JavaScript to start the conditional
//(7 < 10) is the condition to test
//{} contains the code block; this is what JavaScript will run
if (7 < 10) {
    console.log (true);
//this wiill only occur if the statement is false
} else {
    console.log(false);
}

//take the original statement and make it false


//An if/else if/else statement adds a third code block for JavaScript to execute


let x = 10

if (x < 10) {
    console.log (true);
} else if (x > 10) {
    console.log (false);
} else {
    console.log("x is equal to 10");

//You want to create a function that randomly decides what movie you will go to see
//create an if/else if/else statement that utilizes math.random and math.floor to decide between 3 movies

//create a function for your movieChoice

//create a variable, but do not set it equal to anything

//start your if else statement

//set your variable = to a movie

//console.log that movie

//repeat for else if

//repeat for else

//Don't forget to call your function
